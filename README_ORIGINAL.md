# MK64 Portable

A native PSP port of Mario Kart 64 running at 60 FPS in
single-player races and 30 FPS in Adhoc multiplayer -- built on the
[n64decomp/mk64](https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64) decompilation. The game's
C code runs directly on the PSP's MIPS CPU; the N64-specific layers (libultra,
the RSP graphics microcode, the RSP audio microcode) are replaced by a port
layer that drives the PSP's Graphics Engine and audio hardware.

**The EBOOT contains no game data.** On the first start it reads a Mario Kart 64
(USA) ROM that you provide and builds the game data from it. This is an
unofficial fan project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo.

This was created using Claude Fable 5.1. If you do not want AI code on your PSP, this is
not a project for you.

## Features

- 60 fps in single-player races on every PSP model, including the PSP-1000
  (32 MB); the game simulates exactly what the N64 did and shows a picture after
  every simulation step.  Heavy stretches drop to 30 fps for a moment rather
  than run slow.  Menus, split screen and the results screen run at 30 fps.
- Hold Start + Select for 1 second to switch single-player races between
  **Performance Mode** (60 fps) and **Classic Mode** (locked 30 fps). The mode
  name appears briefly and your preference is saved for the next launch.
  Performance Mode is the default; multiplayer stays at 30 fps in both modes.
- All cups and courses: Grand Prix, Time Trial, VS and Battle
- Ad hoc multiplayer: two to four PSPs race or battle over ad hoc WLAN, each
  showing its own player full screen (2P/3P/4P GAME, then HOST or JOIN;
  see `docs/adhoc.md`).  All PSPs need the same build.
- The sound is mixed on the PSP's second processor, the Media Engine, which
  leaves the main CPU to the game
- True widescreen: the 3D view is rendered with a 16:9 field of view, showing more of the track instead of stretching the 4:3 picture; the HUD and menus keep their proportions, anchored to the screen edges
- Music, sound effects and the announcer, mixed on the PSP
- Hardware-accelerated rendering: the N64 display lists are translated to the
  PSP's Graphics Engine, which does the vertex transform and rasterisation
- Saves (Grand Prix progress, ghosts) kept in the game's `data/` folder, with a
  backup copy so an interrupted save cannot wipe your progress

## Installing

You need a PSP that can run homebrew (custom firmware such as ARK-4) and your
own copy of *Mario Kart 64* (USA) as an N64 ROM image (`.z64`, `.n64` or
`.v64` — any byte order works; the file name does not matter).

1. Create `ms0:/PSP/GAME/MK64Portable/` on the Memory Stick and copy `EBOOT.PBP` into it.
2. Copy your ROM into the same folder.
3. Start *MK64 Portable* from the XMB.

The first start shows a progress screen while the game data is built from the
ROM and cached (about 13 MB). Everything the port writes — the cache, the save,
the log, and `mk64k.prx`, the small kernel helper that starts the Media Engine —
goes into a `data/` folder next to the EBOOT. Later starts skip the
extraction. If the ROM is missing, is another game, or is not the USA version,
the port says so and returns to the XMB; nothing is cached from a bad ROM.

Only the USA (NTSC) version is supported. Deleting the `data/` folder forces a
fresh extraction on the next start (you lose the save in it).

## Controls

| PSP | Game |
| --- | --- |
| Analog nub or D-pad | Steer (the D-pad gives full deflection) |
| Cross | A — accelerate |
| Square | B — brake / reverse |
| Circle or L | Z — use item |
| R | R — hop / drift |
| Triangle | C-up — look behind |
| Start (tap) | Start / pause on release |
| Select (tap) | C-right — cycle the race HUD: map, positions, speedometer |
| L / R on the game select screen | Open OPTION / DATA (the N64 L and R) |
| Hold Select for 3 seconds | Show or hide the FPS counter |
| Hold Start + Select for 1 second | Switch Classic / Performance Mode (saved; 1P races only) |

## Building from source

Requirements: the [pspdev](https://pspdev.github.io/) toolchain, GNU make 4
(`gmake` on macOS), CMake and Ninja for the asset extractor, Python 3 with
Pillow, and a Mario Kart 64 (USA) ROM.

```sh
git clone --recursive <this repository>
cd psp_mk64_portable
cp /path/to/your/rom.z64 baserom.us.z64

# host tools and asset extraction (once)
gmake -C tools mio0 n64graphics displaylist_packer n64cksum tkmk00 extract_data_for_mio
python3 extract_assets.py us
cmake -S tools/torch -B tools/torch/cmake-build-release -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE="$PWD/tools/psp/torch_fmt_fix.cmake" && cmake --build tools/torch/cmake-build-release
tools/torch/cmake-build-release/torch code   baserom.us.z64
tools/torch/cmake-build-release/torch header baserom.us.z64

# the PSP build
export PATH="$HOME/pspdev/bin:$PATH"
gmake -f Makefile.psp -j8            # -> build/psp/EBOOT.PBP (ad hoc play and the Media Engine mixer included)
gmake -f Makefile.psp release        # clean build + player README -> release/MK64Portable/ and its zip
```

Run the result in PPSSPP or on a PSP exactly like a release: put a ROM next to
`EBOOT.PBP`. The stock `Makefile` still builds the original N64 ROM.

### How the port works

| N64 mechanism | Port replacement |
| --- | --- |
| libultra (threads, message queues, DMA, VI/AI/SI, EEPROM) | `src/port/ultra_shim.c` — single-threaded, non-blocking queues; the save is a file |
| RSP graphics microcode (F3DEX display lists) | `src/port/gfx/gfx_pc.c`, an F3DEX interpreter, driving `src/port/psp/gfx_scegu.c` (sceGu) with the GE doing transform and lighting |
| RSP audio microcode | `src/port/audio/mixer.c`, a C mixer fed by the game's own `synthesis.c`, run as jobs on the Media Engine (`src/port/psp/me.c`, `tools/psp/mekprx`); `src/port/psp/audio_out.c` resamples to the PSP's 32 kHz output |
| Two VI retraces per game frame | split frames: one picture per simulation tick in 1P races (`docs/fps60.md`) |
| Segmented addressing | `src/port/segments.c` plus generated offset-to-symbol tables |

### Shipping without game data

The objects that hold ROM-derived data are linked into a region the executable
carries no bytes for. At build time, `tools/psp/make_assets.py` extracts that
region from a companion link and `tools/psp/derive_recipes.py` works out, for
every one of its 20,703 symbols, how the bytes derive from the ROM — a raw
range, a compressed block, a byte-order or field pattern, or a slice of a
course's packed display lists. The result (`tools/psp/recipes.json`, numbers
only) is compiled by `tools/psp/emit_recipes.py` into a table that rides in the
EBOOT's `DATA.PSAR`. On the first start `src/port/psp/assets_gen.c` executes
that table against the player's ROM using the game's own decoders, checks the
result against a CRC, and caches it. `gmake -f Makefile.psp assets-recipes`
regenerates the recipes when the set of assets changes; a build with
`EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DPORT_ASSETS_VERIFY` compares an extraction symbol by symbol
against the build-time archive.
